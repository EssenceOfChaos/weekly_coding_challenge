# Week 1

## Palindrome

The coding challenge begins with this easy and frequently asked interview question.

> "Given some input of type `String`, return `true` if the input is a palindrome and `false` otherwise."

Note: A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forwards and backwards. Examples include:

- racecar
- civic
- radar
- level

A palindrome can also include a phrase, such as:

- Live on time, emit no evil
- Step on no pets

Include spaces and punctuation in determining if the string is a palindrome.

## Constraints

- The input should be a string between 0 and 50 characters.

### Examples

`palindrome("abba") === true`
`palindrome("abcdefg") === false`
