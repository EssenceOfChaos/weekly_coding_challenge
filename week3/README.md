# Week 3

## Word count and compare

Compare two files and find the **three** most frequently occuring words in both texts.

The search should be case insensitive.

Ignore the following words: `["a", "an", "the", "and"]`.

Return a map with the top 3 most frequently occuring words along with their frequencies.

For example:

```javascript
{
    "word1": 300,
    "word2": 352,
    "word3": 421
}
```
